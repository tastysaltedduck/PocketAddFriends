Relearning how to code, one script at a time!

The script is nothing special. Start at the "Friends Tab" in PTCGP and run the python script through VSCode.

It is not fast. To reduce the possibility of being flagged for botting, the script goes about as fast as a human could do it.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Requirements:

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

[MuMu](https://www.mumuplayer.com/)

Grab the game's apk from here:

[APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/)

You can click and drag it into MuMu Player and launch it to install

# IMPORTANT! THINGS TO DO BEFORE RUNNING!:

-YOU WILL NEED TO RETAKE THE SCREENSHOTS. This is because of monitors having different DPI and Scaling settings.

-Copy and Paste a list of friend codes. Look at the example.txt. Also remember to remove your own!

# Notes

-The script needs to maintain focus on the emulator, you can run it and leave it for about 10 mins
